        **Key Insights**:
        - The correlation heatmap indicates that both `weathersit` and `dry_precip` exhibit similar correlations with `cnt`, which aligns with expectations.
        - Further testing in predictive models will determine if the simpler `dry_precip` variable or the original `weathersit` provides better performance.

        <h3>Understanding Precipitation Intensity Bins</h3>
        <p>We categorized precipitation levels into three bins based on the <code>weathersit</code> variable:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1</strong>: Represents dry conditions (weathersit 1 and 2).</li>
            <li><strong>2</strong>: Indicates mild precipitation (weathersit 3).</li>
            <li><strong>3</strong>: Denotes heavy precipitation (weathersit 4).</li>

        **Key Insights:**
        - The distribution indicates that dry conditions (bin 1) show higher bike counts.
        - Bins 2 and 3, representing precipitation, show a clear decline in bike counts, with heavy precipitation having the lowest counts.
        - This analysis supports the decision to create distinct bins for better predictive modeling.

        The frequency distribution of weather situations shows that:
        - Weather situation 1 (Clear) has the highest count with 11,413 occurrences.
        - Weather situation 2 (Cloudy) follows with 4,544 observations.
        - Situations with precipitation (3 and 4) are significantly less frequent, with 1,419 for situation 3.
    
        **Conclusion**:
        The limited data for weather situation 4 suggests that it may not be significant for modeling due to its minimal representation. This justifies not considering the `precip_intensity` feature in further analysis.
